    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A baked Italian dish consisting of wide strips of pasta cooked and layered with meat or vegetables, cheese, and tomato sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound of sweet italian sausage</li>
        <li>3/4 pound of lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can of crushed tomoatoes</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons of Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>16 ounces of ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>3/4 pound of mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
        <li>3/4 cup of grated parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather ingredients</li>
        <li>Cook sausage and ground beef in Dutch oven over medium heat</li>
        <li>Stir in crusshed tomoatoes and Italian seasoning. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
